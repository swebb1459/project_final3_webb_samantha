This was quite fun yet challenging. I ended up redoing my project at least three times. There were definitely a ton of jQuery options I wanted to try but didn't have enough time.I needed to focus on the ones I was trying to implement first. The JavaScript one gave me quite some trouble when it came to removing the element. It was an array and I wasn't specify which one I wanted to remove. There was only one but I guess it needs to be specified. If anything, being specific was probably my biggest challenge.

I think I'm going to keep working on this project as it was fun to do. There are several things I want to try out.
