##Resources

* [MixItUp: A Filter & Sort (jQuery) Plugin](https://github.com/patrickkunka/mixitup)

I thought this was so cool. I initially got the idea to have the menu filter from another restaurant's website. This plugin was simple to use and the instructions were easy to follow.

This plugin is found on the menu page.

* [The Responsive jQuery Content Slider](http://bxslider.com/)

This plugin is found on the homepage. It's a slider that features three photos. The documentation of this plugin was easy to follow as well. 

* [Remove all elements of a certain class with JavaScript](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10842471/remove-all-elements-of-a-certain-class-with-javascript)

* [Removing Existing HTML Elements](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_nodes.asp)

I group these two together as they helped me make sense of my JavaScript problem. For my JavaScript I added an element when a user moused over something and then removed that element when the mouse moved away. Getting the element to appear was not difficult. It was getting it disappear that I had trouble with. Turns out I need to be specific as I was calling an array. 

This can be seen on the homepage if you hover over the Gift Cards section.

##Comments

This was quite fun yet challenging. I ended up redoing my project at least three times. There were definitely a ton of jQuery options I wanted to try but didn't have enough time.I needed to focus on the ones I was trying to implement first. The JavaScript one gave me quite some trouble when it came to removing the element. It was an array and I wasn't specify which one I wanted to remove. There was only one but I guess it needs to be specified. If anything, being specific was probably my biggest challenge. I used my class notes a lot as they were extremely helpful.

The JavaScript was harder to figure out but that may be because we have focused on jQuery more recently. I was able to use my notes to figure my jQuery. I changed the background color of the nav when a user hovers over the carousel on the homepage. 

I think I'm going to keep working on this project as it was fun to do. There are several things I want to try out.
